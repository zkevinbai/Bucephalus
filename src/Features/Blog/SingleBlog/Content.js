A little about my background before I begin.  I am a proud Golden Bear, and graduated from the University of California Berkeley.  At Berkeley, I studied a combination of Environmental Science, Economics, and Public Policy.  Looking at me on paper, you might say that I don’t remotely resemble someone who is aiming for software.  And you would be right.

What I wanted to do, was to work for the United Nations.  And it is from there that our journey to software engineering begins.

Growing up, the thing I wanted most was to work for the UN.  It was a fantastic fit for my background, skillset, and passions.  As an immigrant to the United States.  A huge part of my identity has always been the appreciation of new and different cultures.

One of my biggest passions is learning languages.  I was fluent in Chinese, English, and Spanish by the time I finished high school.  Since I already spoke half of the 6 Official Languages of the United Nations.  I challenged myself to learn the other 3 before I graduated.  In time, I spoke French, Arabic, and Russian.

What I care about most is making an impact.  And to me - the United Nations was the best opportunity I saw for me to combine my passions and interests to make a difference in the world.

But I knew that it wouldn’t be easy.  The UN generally does not consider interns without a masters degree.  And while I knew speaking all 6 official languages would give me an edge, I wanted to do more to set myself up for success.

In order to accomplish my goal of working for the UN.  I challenged myself to work in as many industries as possible, and in as many roles as possible.  I reasoned that having this widen breath of experiences would do 3 things for me.

	1. make me a more competitive applicant for the role I wanted
	2. allow me to fully explore my interests and not graduate with regrets
	3. provide me with an insurance policy, and help me make an informed decision if I decide to change tracks with my career

This plan was successful.  In total, I have experienced the Automotive, Entertainment, Healthcare, Finance, and Technology industries.  And I had worked a wide variety of non technical roles roles.

The experience with Technology was especially eye opening.  At Google, I met brilliant colleagues working on fascinating problems.  I’ll never forget how my manager could also speak English, Chinese, and Spanish.  We had a conversation where we would switch languages with each sentence, a first for the both of us.

But as exciting as technology was, the United Nations was the goal.  And so I kept pushing forward with my goals of learning all 6 official languages of the UN, and experiencing as many industries as possible.

Over the course of this journey, I became one of 7 William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Scholars.  I was given a scholarship to live in Dubai, and study the language, culture, history, politics, and economics of the Middle East.

Thanks to my scholarship, I attended a high level UN conference discussing the refugee crisis.  Up until this point, the closest I could have gotten to the UN was a guided tour.  I saw my opportunity, I introduced myself, and I asked for a job.

And just like that, I had achieved my goal of working at the United Nations.  Not only did I not have a master’s degree, I had not even graduated from college at the time.  This achievement represents years of dedication and hard work.  This is something I have always wanted, and there I was, United Nations ID in hand.  I should have been over the moon.  And I was!

Three weeks into the job, I called my mom and told her I did not want to do this for the rest of my life.  To my surprise, I was not happy.

Let me be clear.  I loved my coworkers at the UN.  And I will always be grateful for the opportunity that they gave me.  But this was supposed to be my goal for my life.  And if I was not perfectly happy, I needed to sit down and figure things out.

Here is what I realized.
1. Education is paramount to me.  I love learning new things, and thrive in roles where I can be constantly learning and growing as an individual.  I felt like my career up until that point had been sharpening skills that I had instead of acquiring new ones.
2. I care about opportunities for personal development.  The UN is a very role oriented environment.  Everyone has a specific job to do, and there was not as much of an opportunity to take on new challenges, and new roles.
3. I want to make the biggest positive impact that I can.  The UN, with its mandate to promote the wellbeing of all human beings.  It moves carefully, and deliberately so as to best serve the people of the world.  Therefore, it is a highly bureaucratic environment.

Remember that insurance policy I had mentioned when I was preparing myself for the UN?  Now was the time to cash it in.  I decided that of all the industries that I had been exposed to.  Software would be the best fit for my priorities and interests.

In the software industry, I would be constantly learning as part of my role.  I would have no shortage of opportunities to grow.  And best of all - I realized that if you are working on the right product with the right team.  The work you do as an individual can genuinely change the world.

I had worked in non-technical roles at software companies before.  But I knew that if I was going into this field.  I wanted to be at the heart of it, I wanted to be a software engineer.

With my mind made up, the only question was how?  I first considered teaching myself using online resources.  That was how I learned Python and got my initial exposure to coding.  My background in learning human languages translated well into learning computer languages.  But I wanted to get up to speed as quickly as possible.  And decided that the best way to do that would be with App Academy.

I had heard of App Academy before and knew that it had a good reputation.  It was their claim that they could help you become a software engineer in only 3 months.  Even as an optimist, I was skeptical.  What was the catch?

The catch was the following.
1. You have to get to a minimum level of software knowledge and pass a technical interview to be accepted.
2. The acceptance rate is only 3 percent.
3. The curriculum packs weeks if not months of material into days.  And you are assessed every week on your cumulative comprehension.  If you are unable to grasp at least 80% of the material, you fail the assessment.  If you fail just 2 assessments, you are sent home.

The intensity of the program was unlike anything I have ever experienced.  For 3 months, I worked 16 hours days.  I would wake up at 7 am, attend class from 8 am to 5 pm, and study until 1 am.  Then, I would go to sleep.  Digest code in my dreams, and start again the next morning.  Weekends were a little better, I only put in 12 hours a day on weekends.  I always saved Sunday mornings for laundry.  And would read a chapter of American Gods by Neil Gaiman as my clothes washed and dried.

American Gods was a fantastic pairing with my academy experience.  I drew parallels between myself and the protagonist, our journeys mirrored one another.  I reached the climax of the book as I experienced my most intense week of App Academy.   And by the time the 3 months were up.  I finished a great story, and I became a software engineer.
