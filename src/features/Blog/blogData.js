        When costs drop, people don't buy less—they spend the same and buy more.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This counterintuitive truth has played out across industries for centuries. And it's about to play out again in software development.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Jevons Paradox</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        In 1865, economist William Stanley Jevons observed something strange: as steam engines became more efficient and coal cheaper, Britain consumed more coal, not less. Efficiency improvements didn't reduce consumption—they increased it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The same pattern appears everywhere. When semiconductors got cheaper, we didn't use fewer chips—we put them in everything. When cloud computing costs dropped, we didn't reduce our usage—we built more applications. When storage became affordable, we didn't store less data—we stored everything.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Open-Source Revolution</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Consider what happened in software development from 1998 to 2005. The cost of building software dropped dramatically.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        In 1998, there was no AWS. You had to buy and host your own servers. Python and Ruby weren't really viable yet. For your database, you'd pay Oracle huge sums—MySQL had just come out but wasn't production-ready until version 5.0 in 2005.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        By 2005, everything changed. AWS launched. Python and Ruby became mainstream. MySQL was viable. Open-source tools were everywhere.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This didn't kill software as a business. It led to a lot more software being built—but it didn't make software companies less valuable. It made them <strong>more</strong> valuable.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The On-Premise to SaaS Transition</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The same pattern played out with the shift from on-premise software to SaaS. In 1998, the largest software companies were Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Computer Associates, Adobe, Intuit, Novell, Autodesk, and Sybase.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Some of those names are irrelevant today. But it's striking how many of the largest names in software and SaaS today are the same names from 1998. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Adobe, Intuit—they all successfully transitioned.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        How did they do it? Microsoft built Office 365, shifting from boxed software to subscriptions. Oracle moved its database and enterprise software to the cloud. SAP launched SAP Cloud Platform. Adobe transformed from selling Creative Suite licenses to Creative Cloud subscriptions. Intuit pivoted QuickBooks from desktop software to cloud-based accounting. Each company took a different path, but they all made the transition.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        It took many of these companies years to execute the transition, but they had time. The market, in its shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality, underestimated how long companies had to adapt.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">What This Means for AI</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Today, we're seeing the same dynamic with AI and software development costs. As coding models make it cheaper to build software, some worry this will erode the value of software companies.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        But history suggests the opposite. When development costs drop, companies don't spend less on software—they build more of it. They raise the bar for what's expected. "What do you mean you don't integrate with our CRM?" customers will ask. "What do you mean you don't connect to our accounting system?" "How can you not have a feature that handles our specific workflow?"
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        As the cost of building software comes down, we're going to build massively more of it. New market entrants will have tools to ford existing moats? The new moats will stretch a hundred miles in every direction.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Pattern Holds</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The cost paradox isn't unique to software. It's a fundamental economic principle: when something becomes cheaper, we consume more of it, not less. When refrigerators got cheaper, households didn't buy one—they bought multiple. When TVs became affordable, families didn't stick with one—they put screens in every room. When air travel costs dropped, we didn't fly less—we flew more often and to more places.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Cheaper software development won't kill software companies. It will make them more valuable—because they'll build more, compete on more dimensions, and create more value for customers. The companies that understand this and execute on it will win.

    title: 'Where Foundation Models Can\'t Beat Software Companies',
    author: 'Kevin Bai',

    excerpt: 'Software companies can access foundation models via API, but foundation models can\'t easily replicate complex software systems. This asymmetric advantage creates durable moats that foundation model companies cannot match.',

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        There's an asymmetric advantage in the AI era, and it favors software companies.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Software companies can access foundation models via API. Every model that Anthropic or OpenAI builds, software companies can buy with an API call. But the reverse isn't true—foundation model companies can't easily replicate the complex software systems that companies like Salesforce, ServiceNow, or Rippling have built.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Riding the R&D Wave</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Software companies get to ride the wave of foundation model R&D investment. When Claude gets better, or GPT-5 launches, software companies immediately have access to those improvements. They don't have to train foundation models to compete—they always have the best available models at their disposal.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        But foundation model companies would have to build payroll software. They'd have to get licensing in place. Master end-of-year filings. Handle money movement. Deal with insurance companies and enrollment issues. Help with escalations when things go wrong with tax filing and payments. Make sure they're calculating overtime, wage splits, and everything else correctly. Build a PEO.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why Deep Access Matters</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        AI agents need deep access to systems to be effective. The deeper the access, the better they are.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When someone has a question about how their payroll was calculated, an AI assistant can peer into the payroll codebase and return answers based on the abstract syntax trees there. When you ask about how a certain value came to be in the system, it can query history APIs that aren't publicly accessible to understand where it came from.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        You can't get this access via public APIs. You can't get it via the user's auth token. Controlling their browser won't get it for you. If you're not full-stack, you're going to be stuck drinking data from a straw into your AI-native thing. No one else is going to spend time building the complete, maximally-expressive read-write API for you to do stuff. Why would they?
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Rippling Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        At Rippling, if we were to integrate an AI assistant, it would need deep access to the system to be effective. When someone asks about payroll calculations, it would need to understand not just the public API, but how the calculations work internally—the logic that determines how values are computed, the rules that govern different scenarios, and the context that shapes each result.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This level of access isn't something you can build as an external agent. It requires being part of the system itself. Software companies control that access, and that creates a durable advantage that foundation model companies cannot match.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Salesforce Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The same dynamic applies to other enterprise software companies. Salesforce has built an incredibly complex CRM system over decades. Their AI assistant, Einstein, can access the full depth of that system—the custom objects, the workflows, the data models, the integration points.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        An external agent built by Anthropic or OpenAI could access Salesforce via their public API, but it would be limited. It couldn't see the internal logic, the custom configurations, the complex relationships between objects. It would be working with a fraction of the information that Salesforce's own AI assistant has access to.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This isn't just about data access—it's about understanding the system at its deepest level. That understanding only comes from being part of the system.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Palantir Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Palantir demonstrates this principle in a different way. When Palantir gets inside a company, they deploy their Foundry platform deep into the organization's systems. They integrate with internal databases, legacy systems, and proprietary workflows. Once they're embedded, they can deploy AI models on top of that platform with full access to the company's data and systems.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        An external foundation model company couldn't replicate this. They'd be working through APIs, limited by what the company exposes publicly. But Palantir, once inside, has the deep access needed to make AI models truly effective. They control the platform, they control the access, and they can deploy models that understand the full context of the organization.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This is the same advantage that software companies have—deep access to systems that external agents cannot match. The platform becomes the moat, and the models deployed on top of it are far more powerful than anything that could be built from the outside.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Moat That Can't Be Crossed</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        This dynamic is already evident in the market. Foundation models aren't withholding capabilities from software companies—they're selling access via API. But software companies can and are withholding capabilities from foundation models by controlling access to their systems.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        If this dynamic breaks down—if foundation model companies start refusing to sell access to their models to Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Rippling, and others—it might change how this market evolves. But as long as there are at least three companies building foundation models that are reasonably neck-and-neck, it will be impossible for the labs to cut off access, even if they wanted to.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The foundation model companies are in a death match with each other to eke out six months of lead on underlying model performance. They're not focused on building payroll software or CRM systems. They're focused on the model.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Window of Opportunity</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        All of this requires companies like Rippling, Salesforce, and ServiceNow to do the work to incorporate these capabilities and transform their products to make use of them. This is hard work, and it should be the highest priority initiative within these companies.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        But there is a window for software companies to do this—arguably, a much longer window of opportunity than most people realize. The complexity of these underlying systems, their interface with the real world, and the need for deterministic correctness when dealing with payroll, insurance, and other critical functions all create barriers that foundation models cannot easily cross.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Software companies that lock down this access will have durable advantages over foundation model companies that foundation model companies cannot match. The question isn't whether foundation models will get better—they will. The question is whether software companies will build the deep integration needed to make those models truly effective within their systems.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Asymmetric Advantage</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The advantage is asymmetric. Software companies can access foundation models, but foundation models cannot access the deep internals of software systems. This creates a moat that foundation model companies cannot build a durable R&D advantage against.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Software companies that understand this and execute on it will win. They'll have the best models available, integrated deeply into systems that foundation model companies cannot replicate. That's where the advantage lies.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The strongest moats in software aren't built from algorithms or data structures. They're built from regulatory licenses, money movement capabilities, insurance relationships, and tax system integrations. These are the real-world complexities that foundation models cannot replicate.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Regulatory Maze</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Consider what it takes to operate a payroll and HR system at scale. You need financial and money-transmission licenses in 50 states, plus Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia. Each of these took years of legal work and advocacy.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        You need to be licensed to sell insurance, as a PEO, as a reseller, as a travel agent, and more. These aren't software problems—they're regulatory problems. They require understanding complex legal frameworks, building relationships with regulators, and maintaining compliance across jurisdictions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        I suspect it will be a long time before LLMs can secure this type of regulatory licensing, if they ever will be able to do so. These are human problems that require human relationships, legal expertise, and years of work.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Rippling Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        This is why Rippling is exciting. They've built a system that collides with a lot of "real world atoms"—and they've solved the hard problems that go beyond code.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        You need to move money. You need to issue credit cards and ship them to people. You need reseller relationships that let you ship computers from Apple and Dell. You need to enroll people in health insurance. You need to be wired into the IRS' systems for tax filings, payments, and W2s.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        These problems go beyond code and software. First, you need to understand the real world in ways that make building software difficult—because it needs to account for this messy reality. But also, you need a level of connectivity with the real world that requires much more than just software to recreate.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Rippling has done all of this. They've secured the licenses, built the relationships, and integrated with the real-world systems. That's a moat that cannot be replicated by writing better code or training a better model.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Stripe Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Stripe is another example of a company with real-world moats that go far beyond code. To process payments, you need to be a licensed money transmitter in every state where you operate. You need relationships with banks, card networks, and financial institutions. You need to handle chargebacks, disputes, and fraud detection.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Stripe spent years building these relationships and securing these licenses. They understand the regulatory landscape, the compliance requirements, and the operational complexities of moving money at scale. This isn't something you can replicate with a better algorithm or a larger model.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The same applies to their international expansion. Each country has different regulations, different payment methods, different banking systems. Stripe had to build relationships and secure licenses in each one. That's a real-world moat that goes beyond code.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Epic Example</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Epic demonstrates real-world moats that are even more complex. To build electronic health records and hospital management systems, Epic needed HIPAA compliance, which required years of security audits, privacy controls, and regulatory certifications. They needed to integrate with hundreds of different medical devices, lab systems, and pharmacy networks, each with their own protocols and standards.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Epic built relationships with hospital systems, insurance companies, and state medical boards. They learned medical coding, billing regulations that vary by state, and the complex workflows of different medical specialties. When their software touches medical devices, they need FDA approval. When they handle prescription data, they need to comply with DEA regulations.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Epic spent decades building these relationships, securing these certifications, and understanding these regulations. A foundation model company couldn't replicate this—they'd need to navigate the same regulatory maze, build the same relationships, and earn the same trust. That's a moat that takes years, not months, to build.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Nature of These Moats</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        These real-world moats have a few key characteristics that make them durable:
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        <strong class="font-semibold">They require time:</strong> Regulatory licenses don't happen overnight. They require years of legal work, relationship building, and compliance maintenance.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        <strong class="font-semibold">They require relationships:</strong> You can't automate your way into a relationship with a regulator, an insurance company, or a bank. These are human relationships that require trust and credibility.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        <strong class="font-semibold">They require domain expertise:</strong> Understanding tax law, insurance regulations, and financial compliance isn't something you can learn from a textbook. It requires deep domain knowledge built over years.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        <strong class="font-semibold">They require operational excellence:</strong> When you're moving money or handling payroll, mistakes are costly. You need operational processes, monitoring, and escalation paths that have been refined over years.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why Foundation Models Can't Replicate This</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Foundation models are incredible at many things, but they can't secure regulatory licenses. They can't build relationships with regulators. They can't handle the operational complexity of moving money at scale or processing payroll for thousands of companies.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        These are problems that require more than intelligence—they require institutional knowledge, regulatory relationships, and operational capabilities that have been built over years. A foundation model company would have to start from scratch and spend years building what companies like Rippling and Stripe have already built.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        And by the time they did, the software companies would have moved even further ahead, building more integrations, securing more licenses, and deepening their relationships with the real-world systems they depend on.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Competitive Advantage</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Software companies that operate in regulated spaces or deal with real-world complexity have moats that foundation models cannot easily cross. These moats aren't built from code—they're built from years of regulatory work, relationship building, and operational excellence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        As AI makes it easier to build software, these real-world moats become even more valuable. They're the things that cannot be automated away, cannot be replicated by training a better model, and cannot be built overnight. They're the durable advantages that will matter most in the AI era.

        MCPs are quietly replacing Postman and curl—and most people haven't noticed yet.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Any system with an API I expect to interact with more than once, my default move is to build an MCP around it. Not a script. Not a collection. An MCP.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Once it exists, I can query records, perform simple CRUD operations, explore edge cases, and debug state with minimal prompting and zero bespoke scripting. That workflow makes tools like Postman and curl feel increasingly obsolete. They assume the human is the execution engine. MCPs assume the human provides intent—and the system handles the rest.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This isn't traditional competition. Agentic tools just gave users a shorter path to what they actually want.

        That's why this shift will look less like disruption and more like abandonment.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Chegg and Stack Overflow weren't defeated by better competitors. They were bypassed by users who found easier paths to outcomes. The same dynamic is starting to play out here.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Path Forward</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        This doesn't mean Postman is dead. Stack Overflow found a very real future in a post-agentic world, and there's a strong chance Postman can too.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Every company runs their business differently. The FDE's job is to make the platform fit seamlessly into that reality — not the other way around.

      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em]">The Three Hats of an FDE</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        What makes an FDE unique is that three roles — consultant, product manager, and software engineer — all live in the same person.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Instead of handing off between departments, the FDE carries a problem from discovery all the way to delivery. That's what allows us to move quickly, think holistically, and build exactly what customers need.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The first job of an FDE is to listen.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        FDEs partner with individual contributors, managers, directors, VPs, and C-level leaders to deeply understand how their business runs — what's working, what's breaking, and what "great" looks like.

      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Use technology to solve the problem. Don't get stuck over-engineering or over-perfecting. Ship something that works. Iterate from there.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Perfect Is the Enemy of Done</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I've watched projects fail because engineers couldn't stop perfecting. Three architecture refactors. Five component rewrites. Weeks optimizing code that already runs fine.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Meanwhile, the customer's problem remains unsolved. The business waits. Budget and goodwill burn away.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Solve the Problem</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The best software I've built solved the problem. It wasn't perfect. Sometimes it was messy. But it worked, and it worked quickly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Technology should solve real problems. Not showcase your programming skills. Not prove you can use the latest framework. Not demonstrate architectural purity. <strong>Solve the problem</strong>. Then iterate if needed.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Just Do It</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Phil Knight built Nike by shipping shoes, not by perfecting the manufacturing process in a lab for a decade. He shipped, learned, and improved.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Same principle applies to software. Build it. Ship it. See if it solves the problem. Fix what's broken. Improve what needs improving. Don't wait for perfect. <strong>Just do it</strong>.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I've worked on five continents in dozens of countries. San Francisco, Vienna, Bogotá, Dubai, Manila, Moscow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        We're all the same. So let's have empathy for one another as the world gets smaller.

      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">All Humans Laugh</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I was in a meeting in Vienna, late afternoon, when someone complained about the elevator. Everyone laughed. A few months later, in Bogotá, same time of day, someone made a similar comment about the elevator. Same laughter.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The jokes were different. The languages were different. But that moment of recognition, that shared understanding that we're all just trying to get through the day? That's universal. We all find things funny. We all need to break tension with a joke. Different cultures, different expressions, same emotion.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">All Humans Feel Frustrated</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I watched an engineer in London spend three hours debugging something that should have taken ten minutes. The sigh. The head in hands. The "why isn't this working" muttered under breath. Same scene, different continent: an engineer in Manila, same problem, same three hours, same exact frustration.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        We all get frustrated. We all feel that tension when things aren't working. The language we use to express it might differ, but the feeling is the same. That moment when you're stuck and can't figure out why—that's human, not cultural.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">All Humans Feel Excited</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        In Dubai, I watched a team finally get a deployment working after days of issues. High fives. Big smiles. Relief. In Denver, different team, different project, but when they hit that same breakthrough moment? Same high fives. Same smiles. Same relief.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        We all feel that rush when we solve a hard problem. We all celebrate wins. Different celebrations, different expressions, same excitement. That moment of "finally, it works"—that's universal.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">All Emotions Are Shared</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I've worked with teams communicating in five languages. Built software across different cultures. Seen how business processes vary from region to region.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        But underneath it all? All humans laugh. All humans cry. All humans feel frustrated. All humans feel excited. Just in different languages and cultures. Sure, the expressions differ. But all emotions are shared. We're all the same. So let's have empathy for one another as the world gets smaller.
