        At Rippling, Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) are customer-facing software engineers — technologists who work directly with our largest and most strategic customers to help them get the most out of the Rippling Platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When the stakes are high, when processes are messy, and when building the right solution matters, the FDE steps in — translating between business needs and product capabilities to deliver business outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Every company runs their business differently. Our job is to make Rippling fit seamlessly into that reality — not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em]">The Three Hats of an FDE</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        What makes an FDE unique is that three roles — consultant, product manager, and software engineer — all live in the same person.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Instead of handing off between departments, the FDE carries a problem from discovery all the way to delivery. That's what allows us to move quickly, think holistically, and build exactly what customers need.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🎯 1. Consultant: Turning Understanding Into Trust</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The first job of an FDE is to listen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        We partner with individual contributors, managers, directors, VPs, and C-level leaders to deeply understand how their business runs — what's working, what's breaking, and what "great" looks like.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs earn trust through clarity and insight, not jargon. We identify the root problem behind the symptoms and align everyone around a shared goal.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🧭 2. Product Manager: Finding the Goldilocks Zone</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Once trust is built, discovery begins.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs roll up their sleeves and talk with the people who live the workflows every day — payroll admins, HR ops teams, finance managers, and IT leaders.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our goal: to find the "Goldilocks zone" — the problem that's most valuable to solve and most straightforward to achieve with Rippling's Platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        There are very few things we can't build — if the APIs are there, we can make it happen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bring product thinking to every customer conversation, helping identify the fastest path to measurable impact.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">💻 3. Software Engineer: Delivering the Solution</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Then, we build.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs are full-stack software engineers who deliver working software — not slide decks or demos.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We build using Rippling Platform's coding and no-code tools to design and deploy Custom Apps, Functions, Data Models, Workflows, Reports, and Integrations that make the platform work exactly the way each customer needs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our role is to extend Rippling's Platform and solve whatever problem is top of mind for the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our goal as a company is to be the system of work — to free smart people to focus on hard problems, not manual ones.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        If your challenge involves your employees, we'll aim to solve it for you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        And when the solution is live, we stay close — ensuring teams adopt it, see value, and expand on it.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">What We Build With</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs build using the Rippling Platform, the same technology stack that powers Rippling's own applications.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        That means every solution we deliver is secure, scalable, and fully integrated into your existing Rippling environment — no bolted-on code, no fragile middleware.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-2">
        Here are some of the core building blocks we use every day:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-none m-0 p-0 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">⚙️ Databridge:</strong> Connect Rippling to systems like Salesforce, Greenhouse, or Jira — syncing data automatically.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔄 Transformations:</strong> Clean, map, and merge data between systems so teams can operate from a single source of truth.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🧠 Functions:</strong> Custom logic written in TypeScript that extends Rippling's capabilities — enabling everything from data validation to advanced calculations.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">📊 Reports & Dashboards:</strong> Turn raw data into actionable insights across HR, finance, and operations.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🧱 Custom Objects & Fields:</strong> Model your unique business entities directly in Rippling — from commission plans to project codes.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">💡 Custom Apps:</strong> Build fully tailored applications that live inside Rippling, complete with UI, workflows, and permissions.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔔 Workflows:</strong> Automate onboarding, offboarding, compliance tasks, or multi-step approvals — all without leaving the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Each solution we build feels custom — but because it's built natively within Rippling's platform, it scales, updates, and evolves seamlessly as your business grows.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why It Matters</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Modern businesses don't fit neatly into templates. They're dynamic, interconnected, and constantly evolving.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bridge the gap between your company's goals and Rippling's platform — ensuring that the technology works the way your business does, not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Whether it's syncing data across systems, automating complex approval logic, or creating entirely new applications, FDEs help our customers turn their ideas into real, working software — faster than ever before.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">In Short</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The FDE is Rippling's bridge between the potential of the Rippling Platform and the goals of the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We're here to solve any problem that stands in the way of running your business — quickly, creatively, and at scale.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        At Rippling, the FDE's mission is simple:

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Technology is the means, not the goal.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        This principle has guided my approach to building software for over a decade. Too often, we fall in love with the technology itself—the latest framework, the newest language, the shiniest tool—and lose sight of what we're actually trying to accomplish.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Purpose-Driven Approach</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Every piece of software I build starts with a question: <strong>What problem are we solving?</strong> Not "What cool technology can we use?" but "What outcome do we want to create?"
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        When you begin with the problem, technology becomes a tool in service of a goal. You choose React not because it's trendy, but because it's the right tool for building interactive UIs. You choose Python not because it's popular, but because it solves the data processing challenge at hand.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Solving Real Problems</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The best software I've built solves problems that matter: improving efficiency for teams, enabling better decision-making for leaders, creating measurable value for businesses.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Technology should serve a purpose—whether that's improving <strong>enterprise operations</strong>, enabling <strong>better decision-making</strong>, or creating <strong>meaningful impact</strong>. When technology becomes the goal itself, we lose sight of why we're building in the first place.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Impact Mindset</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        At the end of the day, what matters isn't the stack you used or the patterns you followed. What matters is: <strong>Did it work? Did it solve the problem? Did it create value?</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Technology is a powerful means to an end. But it's only powerful when we remember what that end actually is.

        I've had the privilege of building software across six continents, working with teams from San Francisco to London to Bogotá. Each location taught me something different about engineering, culture, and what it means to solve problems at scale.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Universal Language of Code</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Code is universal, but context is everything. The same TypeScript function that works in Silicon Valley might need different considerations when deployed in Europe due to data regulations, or in Latin America due to network infrastructure.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Building software for <strong>Fortune 500 companies</strong> means understanding not just the technical requirements, but the business context, regulatory environment, and cultural nuances that shape how technology gets used.

      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Complexity of International Deployment</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Navigating the complexities of <strong>international software deployment</strong> taught me that good engineering is about more than clean code—it's about understanding constraints, anticipating edge cases, and building systems that work across diverse environments.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Time zones, languages, regulations, and infrastructure differences all shape how software gets built and deployed. The best engineers I've worked with don't just write code—they understand the full context in which that code will run.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Building for Global Scale</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Working across six continents has taught me that the best solutions are those that respect local context while maintaining global standards. You can't build the same way everywhere, but you can build with the same principles: clarity, efficiency, and impact.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        The tools change. The languages change. The regulations change. But the goal remains the same: build technology that solves real problems, wherever those problems exist.
