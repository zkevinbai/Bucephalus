        MCPs are quietly replacing Postman and curl—and most people haven't noticed yet.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        For me, this is already true.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Any system with an API I expect to interact with more than once, my default move is to build an MCP around it. Not a script. Not a collection. An MCP.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Once it exists, I can query records, perform simple CRUD operations, explore edge cases, and debug state with minimal prompting and zero bespoke scripting. That workflow makes tools like Postman and curl feel increasingly obsolete. They assume the human is the execution engine. MCPs assume the human provides intent—and the system handles the rest.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        This isn't traditional competition. Agentic tools just gave users a shorter path to what they actually want.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Bypass, Not the Battle</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        That's why this shift will look less like disruption and more like abandonment.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Chegg and Stack Overflow weren't defeated by better competitors. They were bypassed by users who found easier paths to outcomes. The same dynamic is starting to play out here.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">The Path Forward</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        This doesn't mean Postman is dead. Stack Overflow found a very real future in a post-agentic world, and there's a strong chance Postman can too.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        But that path isn't guaranteed—and it's theirs to choose.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">

        Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) are customer-facing software engineers — technologists who work directly with customers to help them get the most out of the platform and solve their most challenging problems.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When the stakes are high, when processes are messy, and when building the right solution matters, the FDE steps in — translating between business needs and product capabilities to deliver business outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Every company runs their business differently. The FDE's job is to make the platform fit seamlessly into that reality — not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em]">The Three Hats of an FDE</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        What makes an FDE unique is that three roles — consultant, product manager, and software engineer — all live in the same person.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Instead of handing off between departments, the FDE carries a problem from discovery all the way to delivery. That's what allows us to move quickly, think holistically, and build exactly what customers need.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🎯 1. Consultant: Turning Understanding Into Trust</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The first job of an FDE is to listen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        FDEs partner with individual contributors, managers, directors, VPs, and C-level leaders to deeply understand how their business runs — what's working, what's breaking, and what "great" looks like.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs earn trust through clarity and insight, not jargon. We identify the root problem behind the symptoms and align everyone around a shared goal.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🧭 2. Product Manager: Finding the Goldilocks Zone</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Once trust is built, discovery begins.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs roll up their sleeves and talk with the people who live the workflows every day — understanding their pain points, their processes, and what would make their lives easier.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The goal: to find the "Goldilocks zone" — the problem that's most valuable to solve and most straightforward to achieve with the platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        There are very few things we can't build — if the APIs are there, we can make it happen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bring product thinking to every customer conversation, helping identify the fastest path to measurable impact.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Then, we build.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs are full-stack software engineers who deliver working software — not slide decks or demos.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We build using the platform's coding and no-code tools to design and deploy Custom Apps, Functions, Data Models, Workflows, Reports, and Integrations that make the platform work exactly the way each customer needs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our role is to extend the platform and solve whatever problem is top of mind for the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The goal is to free smart people to focus on hard problems, not manual ones.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        And when the solution is live, we stay close — ensuring teams adopt it, see value, and expand on it.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">What We Build With</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs build using the platform, the same technology stack that powers the core product.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        That means every solution we deliver is secure, scalable, and fully integrated into the existing environment — no bolted-on code, no fragile middleware.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-2">
        Here are some of the core building blocks we use every day:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-none m-0 p-0 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">⚙️ Databridge:</strong> Connect systems together — syncing data automatically between platforms.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔄 Transformations:</strong> Clean, map, and merge data between systems so teams can operate from a single source of truth.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🧠 Functions:</strong> Custom logic written in TypeScript that extends capabilities — enabling everything from data validation to advanced calculations.
        </li>

          <strong class="font-semibold">🧱 Custom Objects & Fields:</strong> Model unique business entities directly in the platform — from commission plans to project codes.

          <strong class="font-semibold">💡 Custom Apps:</strong> Build fully tailored applications that live inside the platform, complete with UI, workflows, and permissions.

          <strong class="font-semibold">🔔 Workflows:</strong> Automate onboarding, offboarding, compliance tasks, or multi-step approvals — all without leaving the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Each solution we build feels custom — but because it's built natively within the platform, it scales, updates, and evolves seamlessly as the business grows.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why It Matters</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Modern businesses don't fit neatly into templates. They're dynamic, interconnected, and constantly evolving.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bridge the gap between a company's goals and the platform — ensuring that the technology works the way the business does, not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Whether it's syncing data across systems, automating complex approval logic, or creating entirely new applications, FDEs help customers turn their ideas into real, working software — faster than ever before.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">In Short</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The FDE is the bridge between the potential of the platform and the goals of the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We're here to solve any problem that stands in the way of running a business — quickly, creatively, and at scale.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">

        Technology should solve real problems. Not showcase your programming skills. Not prove you can use the latest framework. Not demonstrate architectural purity. <strong>Solve the problem</strong>. Then iterate if needed.

        In Dubai, I watched a team finally get a deployment working after days of issues. High fives. Big smiles. Relief. In Denver, different team, different project, but when they hit that same breakthrough moment? Same high fives. Same smiles. Same relief.

        We all feel that rush when we solve a hard problem. We all celebrate wins. Different celebrations, different expressions, same excitement. That moment of "finally, it works"—that's universal.

        I've worked with teams communicating in five languages. Built software across different cultures. Seen how business processes vary from region to region.

        But underneath it all? All humans laugh. All humans cry. All humans feel frustrated. All humans feel excited. Just in different languages and cultures. Sure, the expressions differ. But all emotions are shared. We're all the same. So let's have empathy for one another as the world gets smaller.
