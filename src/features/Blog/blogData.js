        Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) are customer-facing software engineers — technologists who work directly with customers to help them get the most out of the platform and solve their most challenging problems.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When the stakes are high, when processes are messy, and when building the right solution matters, the FDE steps in — translating between business needs and product capabilities to deliver business outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Every company runs their business differently. The FDE's job is to make the platform fit seamlessly into that reality — not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em]">The Three Hats of an FDE</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        What makes an FDE unique is that three roles — consultant, product manager, and software engineer — all live in the same person.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Instead of handing off between departments, the FDE carries a problem from discovery all the way to delivery. That's what allows us to move quickly, think holistically, and build exactly what customers need.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🎯 1. Consultant: Turning Understanding Into Trust</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The first job of an FDE is to listen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        FDEs partner with individual contributors, managers, directors, VPs, and C-level leaders to deeply understand how their business runs — what's working, what's breaking, and what "great" looks like.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs earn trust through clarity and insight, not jargon. We identify the root problem behind the symptoms and align everyone around a shared goal.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🧭 2. Product Manager: Finding the Goldilocks Zone</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Once trust is built, discovery begins.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs roll up their sleeves and talk with the people who live the workflows every day — understanding their pain points, their processes, and what would make their lives easier.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The goal: to find the "Goldilocks zone" — the problem that's most valuable to solve and most straightforward to achieve with the platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        There are very few things we can't build — if the APIs are there, we can make it happen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bring product thinking to every customer conversation, helping identify the fastest path to measurable impact.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">💻 3. Software Engineer: Delivering the Solution</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Then, we build.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs are full-stack software engineers who deliver working software — not slide decks or demos.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We build using the platform's coding and no-code tools to design and deploy Custom Apps, Functions, Data Models, Workflows, Reports, and Integrations that make the platform work exactly the way each customer needs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our role is to extend the platform and solve whatever problem is top of mind for the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The goal is to free smart people to focus on hard problems, not manual ones.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        And when the solution is live, we stay close — ensuring teams adopt it, see value, and expand on it.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">What We Build With</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs build using the platform, the same technology stack that powers the core product.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        That means every solution we deliver is secure, scalable, and fully integrated into the existing environment — no bolted-on code, no fragile middleware.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-2">
        Here are some of the core building blocks we use every day:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-none m-0 p-0 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">⚙️ Databridge:</strong> Connect systems together — syncing data automatically between platforms.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔄 Transformations:</strong> Clean, map, and merge data between systems so teams can operate from a single source of truth.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🧠 Functions:</strong> Custom logic written in TypeScript that extends capabilities — enabling everything from data validation to advanced calculations.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">📊 Reports & Dashboards:</strong> Turn raw data into actionable insights across HR, finance, and operations.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🧱 Custom Objects & Fields:</strong> Model unique business entities directly in the platform — from commission plans to project codes.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">💡 Custom Apps:</strong> Build fully tailored applications that live inside the platform, complete with UI, workflows, and permissions.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔔 Workflows:</strong> Automate onboarding, offboarding, compliance tasks, or multi-step approvals — all without leaving the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Each solution we build feels custom — but because it's built natively within the platform, it scales, updates, and evolves seamlessly as the business grows.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why It Matters</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Modern businesses don't fit neatly into templates. They're dynamic, interconnected, and constantly evolving.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bridge the gap between a company's goals and the platform — ensuring that the technology works the way the business does, not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Whether it's syncing data across systems, automating complex approval logic, or creating entirely new applications, FDEs help customers turn their ideas into real, working software — faster than ever before.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">In Short</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The FDE is the bridge between the potential of the platform and the goals of the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We're here to solve any problem that stands in the way of running a business — quickly, creatively, and at scale.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The FDE's mission is simple:

      <p class="font-raleway text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8 italic">
        Make the platform work your way — and turn possibilities into outcomes that matter.

      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When you aim for perfect technology, you're in academia territory. You're in the ivory tower. And you're likely wasting time, money, or both.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Use technology to solve the problem. Don't get stuck over-engineering or over-perfecting. Ship something that works. Iterate from there.

      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Perfect Is the Enemy of Done</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        I've watched projects fail because engineers couldn't stop perfecting. Three architecture refactors. Five component rewrites. Weeks optimizing code that already runs fine.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Meanwhile, the customer's problem remains unsolved. The business waits. Budget and goodwill burn away.

      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Solve the Problem</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        The best software I've built solved the problem. It wasn't perfect. Sometimes it was messy. But it worked, and it worked quickly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Technology should solve real problems. Not showcase your programming skills. Not prove you can use the latest framework. Not demonstrate architectural purity. <strong>Solve the problem</strong>. Then iterate if needed.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Just Do It</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        Phil Knight built Nike by shipping shoes, not by perfecting the manufacturing process in a lab for a decade. He shipped, learned, and improved.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Same principle applies to software. Build it. Ship it. See if it solves the problem. Fix what's broken. Improve what needs improving. Don't wait for perfect. <strong>Just do it</strong>.
