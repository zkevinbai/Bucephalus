        At Rippling, Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) are customer-facing software engineers — technologists who work directly with our largest and most strategic customers to help them get the most out of the Rippling Platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        When the stakes are high, when processes are messy, and when building the right solution matters, the FDE steps in — translating between business needs and product capabilities to deliver business outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Every company runs their business differently. Our job is to make Rippling fit seamlessly into that reality — not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em]">The Three Hats of an FDE</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        What makes an FDE unique is that three roles — consultant, product manager, and software engineer — all live in the same person.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Instead of handing off between departments, the FDE carries a problem from discovery all the way to delivery. That's what allows us to move quickly, think holistically, and build exactly what customers need.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🎯 1. Consultant: Turning Understanding Into Trust</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The first job of an FDE is to listen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        We partner with individual contributors, managers, directors, VPs, and C-level leaders to deeply understand how their business runs — what's working, what's breaking, and what "great" looks like.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs earn trust through clarity and insight, not jargon. We identify the root problem behind the symptoms and align everyone around a shared goal.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">🧭 2. Product Manager: Finding the Goldilocks Zone</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Once trust is built, discovery begins.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs roll up their sleeves and talk with the people who live the workflows every day — payroll admins, HR ops teams, finance managers, and IT leaders.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our goal: to find the "Goldilocks zone" — the problem that's most valuable to solve and most straightforward to achieve with Rippling's Platform.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        There are very few things we can't build — if the APIs are there, we can make it happen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bring product thinking to every customer conversation, helping identify the fastest path to measurable impact.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="font-raleway text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-4 mt-8 tracking-[-0.01em]">💻 3. Software Engineer: Delivering the Solution</h3>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Then, we build.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs are full-stack software engineers who deliver working software — not slide decks or demos.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We build using Rippling Platform's coding and no-code tools to design and deploy Custom Apps, Functions, Data Models, Workflows, Reports, and Integrations that make the platform work exactly the way each customer needs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our role is to extend Rippling's Platform and solve whatever problem is top of mind for the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Our goal as a company is to be the system of work — to free smart people to focus on hard problems, not manual ones.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        If your challenge involves your employees, we'll aim to solve it for you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        And when the solution is live, we stay close — ensuring teams adopt it, see value, and expand on it.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">What We Build With</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        FDEs build using the Rippling Platform, the same technology stack that powers Rippling's own applications.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        That means every solution we deliver is secure, scalable, and fully integrated into your existing Rippling environment — no bolted-on code, no fragile middleware.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-2">
        Here are some of the core building blocks we use every day:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-none m-0 p-0 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">⚙️ Databridge:</strong> Connect Rippling to systems like Salesforce, Greenhouse, or Jira — syncing data automatically.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">🔄 Transformations:</strong> Clean, map, and merge data between systems so teams can operate from a single source of truth.
        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">

        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">
          <strong class="font-semibold">📊 Reports & Dashboards:</strong> Turn raw data into actionable insights across HR, finance, and operations.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em]">

        </li>

          <strong class="font-semibold">🔔 Workflows:</strong> Automate onboarding, offboarding, compliance tasks, or multi-step approvals — all without leaving the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Each solution we build feels custom — but because it's built natively within Rippling's platform, it scales, updates, and evolves seamlessly as your business grows.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">Why It Matters</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        Modern businesses don't fit neatly into templates. They're dynamic, interconnected, and constantly evolving.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        FDEs bridge the gap between your company's goals and Rippling's platform — ensuring that the technology works the way your business does, not the other way around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8">
        Whether it's syncing data across systems, automating complex approval logic, or creating entirely new applications, FDEs help our customers turn their ideas into real, working software — faster than ever before.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="font-raleway text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-6 tracking-[-0.01em] mt-8">In Short</h2>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        The FDE is Rippling's bridge between the potential of the Rippling Platform and the goals of the customer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-4">
        We're here to solve any problem that stands in the way of running your business — quickly, creatively, and at scale.
      </p>
      
      <p class="font-raleway text-base font-light text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-6">
        At Rippling, the FDE's mission is simple:

      <p class="font-raleway text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 m-0 leading-[1.7] tracking-[0.01em] mb-8 italic">
        Make the platform work your way — and turn possibilities into outcomes that matter.
