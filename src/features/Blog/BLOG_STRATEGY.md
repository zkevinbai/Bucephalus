# Blog Content Strategy

## Voice & Tone

### Core Principles

**Direct and Clear**
- No jargon. No hedging. Say what you mean.
- Use simple language, even for complex topics.
- "Technology is the means, not the goal." Not "Technology should be considered as a means rather than an end goal."

**Engineer's Perspective**
- Write from experience, not theory.
- Ground arguments in real examples: "I've watched projects fail because engineers couldn't stop perfecting."
- Show, don't tell. Use concrete examples over abstract concepts.

**Practical Over Perfect**
- Focus on what works, not what's theoretically optimal.
- Acknowledge messy reality: "Every company runs their business differently."
- Value execution over perfection: "Ship something that works. Iterate from there."

**Confident but Not Arrogant**
- Make strong statements: "This counterintuitive truth has played out across industries for centuries."
- Support with evidence, not qualifiers.
- Trust the reader to understand nuance without hedging.

### Writing Style

**Opening Hooks**
- Start with a strong, declarative statement:
  - "When costs drop, people don't buy less—they spend the same and buy more."
  - "Technology is the means, not the goal."
  - "MCPs are quietly replacing Postman and curl—and most people haven't noticed yet."
- Get to the point immediately. No long wind-ups.

**Paragraph Structure**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences typically).
- One idea per paragraph.
- Use spacing to create rhythm and emphasis.

**Section Headings**
- Clear, descriptive headings that preview the content.
- Use "The [Concept]" format for major sections: "The Jevons Paradox", "The Cost Paradox", "The Real-World Moat"
- Use numbered lists or emoji for sub-sections when helpful: "🎯 1. Consultant: Turning Understanding Into Trust"

**Examples and Evidence**
- Use real companies: Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Stripe, Epic, Salesforce, Palantir
- Use historical analogies: 1998 software companies, open-source revolution, on-prem to SaaS transition
- Use concrete scenarios: "When someone asks about payroll calculations..."
- Mix specific and general examples appropriately

**Language Patterns**
- Prefer active voice: "Software companies can access foundation models" not "Foundation models can be accessed by software companies"
- Use contractions naturally: "don't", "can't", "won't"
- Avoid corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "paradigm shift"
- Use strong verbs: "build", "solve", "win" not "facilitate", "enable", "optimize"

## Content Themes

### Primary Topics

**Forward Deployed Engineering**
- What FDEs do and why it matters
- The intersection of consulting, product management, and engineering
- Building solutions that fit the customer's reality

**Enterprise Software**
- How software companies compete and win
- The moats that matter (regulatory, real-world complexity, deep access)
- The relationship between software and business outcomes

**Technology Philosophy**
- Technology as a means, not a goal
- The cost of perfectionism
- Solving real problems over showcasing skills

**Building Technology**
- What makes technology effective
- The importance of execution
- Learning from historical patterns

### Content Approach

**Use Historical Analogies**
- Draw parallels to past transitions (on-prem to SaaS, open-source revolution)
- Show patterns that repeat: "The same pattern appears everywhere."
- Learn from what worked: "Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Adobe, Intuit—they all successfully transitioned."

**Focus on Real-World Complexity**
- Acknowledge that software exists in messy reality
- Regulatory requirements, money movement, insurance, tax systems
- These aren't software problems—they're real-world problems that software must solve

**Explain the "Why"**
- Don't just state what happens—explain why it matters
- Connect technical concepts to business outcomes
- Show the implications: "This creates a moat that foundation model companies cannot match."

## Structure Guidelines

### Post Length
- Target 5-8 minute reads
- Longer posts (8+ min) are fine if the content warrants it
- Shorter posts (3-5 min) work for focused topics

### Post Organization

**Opening**
- Strong hook (1-2 paragraphs)
- Set up the core argument or observation

**Body**
- 3-5 major sections with clear headings
- Each section builds on the previous
- Use examples to illustrate points
- Mix specific examples with general principles

**Conclusion**
- Reinforce the main point
- End with a forward-looking statement or call to action
- Keep it brief—don't rehash everything

### Example Structure (from existing posts)

**"The Cost Paradox"**
1. Opening hook: The counterintuitive truth
2. Historical proof: Jevons Paradox
3. Software examples: Open-source revolution, on-prem to SaaS
4. Application: What this means for AI era
5. Conclusion: The pattern holds

**"Where Foundation Models Can't Beat Software Companies"**
1. Opening: The asymmetric advantage
2. Why software companies win: Access to models
3. Deep access requirement: Why it matters
4. Examples: Rippling, Salesforce, Palantir
5. The moat: Controlling access
6. Conclusion: The advantage

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

✅ Start with a strong, declarative statement
✅ Use concrete examples from real companies
✅ Draw on historical patterns and analogies
✅ Write short, focused paragraphs
✅ Use clear section headings
✅ Ground arguments in experience
✅ Make strong statements without hedging
✅ Explain why things matter, not just what they are

### Don't

❌ Use jargon or corporate speak
❌ Hedge with "might", "perhaps", "could potentially"
❌ Write long, meandering paragraphs
❌ Use abstract concepts without examples
❌ Over-explain obvious points
❌ Use passive voice unnecessarily
❌ Make claims without evidence
❌ Write in a way that sounds like marketing copy

## Examples of Voice

### Good Opening (from "Technology as a Means")
```
Technology is the means, not the goal.

When you aim for perfect technology, you're in academia territory. 
You're in the ivory tower. And you're likely wasting time, money, or both.
```

### Good Example Usage (from "The Cost Paradox")
```
In 1998, there was no AWS. You had to buy and host your own servers. 
Python and Ruby weren't really viable yet. For your database, you'd pay 
Oracle huge sums—MySQL had just come out but wasn't production-ready 
until version 5.0 in 2005.

By 2005, everything changed. AWS launched. Python and Ruby became 
mainstream. MySQL was viable. Open-source tools were everywhere.
```

### Good Strong Statement (from "Where Foundation Models Can't Beat Software Companies")
```
Software companies that understand this and execute on it will win. 
They'll have the best models available, integrated deeply into systems 
that foundation model companies cannot replicate. That's where the 
advantage lies.
```

## Categories

Current categories:
- **Technology**: Technical topics, industry trends, software development
- **FDE**: Forward deployed engineering, customer-facing engineering
- **Philosophy**: Technology philosophy, principles, approaches
- **Experience**: Personal experiences, lessons learned

Use categories to help readers find related content, but don't force-fit posts into categories.

## Final Notes

**Write for yourself first**
- If you find it interesting, others will too
- Don't write what you think people want to hear
- Write what you've learned and what you believe

**Trust your experience**
- You've worked across five continents
- You've seen what works and what doesn't
- Your perspective is valuable—share it directly

**Keep it simple**
- Complex ideas can be explained simply
- If you can't explain it simply, you might not understand it well enough
- Clarity beats cleverness every time
